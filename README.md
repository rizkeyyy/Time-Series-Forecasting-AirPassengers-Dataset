📈 Time Series Forecasting on AirPassengers Dataset
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates time series analysis and forecasting using the classic AirPassengers dataset (1949–1960).
The main goal is to forecast the number of airline passengers for the next 24 months using ARIMA/SARIMA models.

Key steps performed:

Data exploration & visualization

Stationarity check (ADF Test)

Differencing to achieve stationarity

ACF & PACF analysis

ARIMA model selection & diagnostics

Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) modeling

Forecasting future passenger counts

📂 Dataset

Name: AirPassengers.csv

Description: Monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

Columns:

Month: Date (monthly)

Passengers: Number of passengers

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

statsmodels → time series modeling (ADF test, ARIMA, SARIMA)

🔬 Methodology
1. Data Exploration

Initial plot shows upward trend and clear seasonal pattern.

2. Stationarity Test

ADF Test on raw data → non-stationary (p-value > 0.9).

After 1st differencing (d=1) → near-stationary (p-value ≈ 0.05).

Final choice: d=1 + seasonal differencing (D=1, m=12).

3. ACF & PACF

Used to identify potential AR (p) and MA (q) terms.

4. ARIMA Modeling

Candidate models tested: (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (2,1,0), (2,1,1).

Best ARIMA (based on AIC): ARIMA(2,1,1).

Residuals checked → not fully white noise.

5. SARIMA Modeling

Added seasonal terms.

Best model: SARIMA(2,1,1)(1,1,0,12) with lowest AIC.

Residual diagnostics & Ljung-Box test → residuals behave like white noise.

6. Forecasting

Forecasted 24 months ahead (1961–1962).

Results show continued upward trend with seasonal fluctuations.

📊 Forecast Plot

Here’s the forecast result with confidence intervals:

✅ Conclusion

The AirPassengers dataset exhibits both trend and seasonality.

After differencing, data became stationary enough for modeling.

SARIMA(2,1,1)(1,1,0,12) was selected as the best-fit model.

Forecast indicates continued growth in air travel with strong seasonal peaks.
